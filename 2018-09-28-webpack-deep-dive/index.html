    ```

    function printMessage() {
      console.log(message);

    ]

    - What if `message.js` is included before `printMessage.js`?
    - What if multiple files use the variable name `message`?
    ]

    ### Without a module bundler...

    .slides-content[
    - the `&lt;script>` order is important
    - top-level variables and functions are global

    As your application grows, this becomes a problem.
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    And there's an additional problem:

    All module systems are slow to initialize when a lot of modules need to be loaded.
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    This is due to the **roundtrip problem**:

    Module bundlers...

    ...**analyze JavaScript modules** by reading their source code...<br>
    ...to generate **compatible and efficient script JavaScript files** (bundle).

    ---

    Module bundlers leverage the fact that all<br>module systems share the same **mental model**:

    - A module has a **unique id**
    - Modules reference other modules<br>as dependency via **specifiers**
    - A module specifier can be resolved to a module id

    ---

    This model is called the **dependency graph**.

    ---

    A dependency graph can be simple...

    <img src="assets/dep-graph-simple.svg" height="450">

    ---

    ...or complex...

    <img src="assets/dep-graph-complex.png" height="450">

    ---

    ...or **very** complex.

    .slides-content[
    Module bundlers...

    ...try to gather as much information as possible about the dependency graph
    in order to apply **clever optimizations**.

    ## How does webpack work?

    .slides-content[
    The best way to understand webpack is to follow the steps
    webpack takes when someone runs:

    ```
    webpack
    ```
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/5c5e902c8e89afeb51ad130f12a908b89d627fc5/lib/webpack.js#L26-L32">`lib/webpack.js`</a>

    .slides-caption[
    **Step 2:** Create `Compiler` instance.
    ]
    ]

    ---

    ### `Compiler`

    - Owns the webpack configuration
    - Owns one or multiple `compilations`
    - Kicks off the actual `compilation` process
    - Is responsible for writing (emitting) the output files
    - Stays alive in `watch` mode

    .slides-caption[
    **Step 4:** Trigger compilation lifecycle hooks
    ]
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    Everything inside webpack is built of plugins which rely on a common interface, called [Tapable](https://github.com/webpack/tapable):

    <img src="assets/webpack-tapable.jpg" width="700" />

    ```
    npm install tapable
    ```
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    A **tapable instance** exposes hooks...

    <img src="assets/webpack-tapable-example-1.jpg" width="700" />
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ...and **plugins** can listen on these hooks.

    <img src="assets/webpack-tapable-example-2.jpg" width="700" />
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/5c5e902c8e89afeb51ad130f12a908b89d627fc5/lib/Compiler.js#L43">`lib/Compiler.js`</a>

    <img src="assets/webpack-hooks-compiler.jpg" width="700" />

    .slides-caption[
    The `Compiler` class exposes a lot of hooks.

    .slides-content[
    <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/5c5e902c8e89afeb51ad130f12a908b89d627fc5/lib/Compiler.js#L43">`lib/Compiler.js`</a>

    <img src="assets/webpack-hooks-compiler.jpg" width="700" />

    .slides-caption[
    The hook type specifies the control flow of the hook (sync/async, bail/waterfall/parallel).
    ]
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/5c5e902c8e89afeb51ad130f12a908b89d627fc5/lib/Compiler.js#L43">`lib/Compiler.js`</a>

    .slides-caption[
    Let's take a closer look at the `shouldEmit` hook.

    The `shouldEmit` hook can be used by plugins to tell the compiler
    that no files should be written on disk.

    <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/8837b6f35b8543fa6b3943e0d3e234b8897f13d4/lib/NoEmitOnErrorsPlugin.js#L9-L11">`lib/NoEmitOnErrorsPlugin.js`</a>

    <img src="assets/webpack-tap-example-3.jpg" width="700" />

    .slides-caption[
    For instance: the hook is "tapped" by the `NoEmitOnErrorsPlugin` which returns false if an error is found in the compilation stats.
    ]
    ]

    .slides-content[
    <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/8837b6f35b8543fa6b3943e0d3e234b8897f13d4/lib/Compiler.js#L214">`lib/Compiler.js`</a>

    <img src="assets/webpack-tap-example-4.jpg" width="700" />

    .slides-caption[
    The `Compiler` triggers the `shouldEmit` hook after all compilation hooks have been triggered, asking "anyone" if the next `emitAssets` hook should be triggered?

    .slides-content[
    You might wonder:

    ### How does the `NoEmitOnErrorsPlugin` get activated?

    <img src="assets/webpack-options-plugin-example.jpg" width="700" />

    .slides-caption[
    The plugin is activated if you set `optimization.noEmitOnErrors` in your `webpack.config.js`.

    <img src="assets/webpack-options-plugin-example.jpg" width="700" />

    .slides-caption[
    `WebpackOptionsApply` is a good starting point if you want to know which webpack option triggers which plugin.

    .slides-content[
    <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/bf0d0d8f9196cbae65a80b8ddafcd1136b762c4f/lib/Compiler.js#L536">`lib/Compiler.js`</a>

    <img src="assets/webpack-step-5.jpg" width="700" />

    .slides-caption[
    **Step 5**: Now the `Compiler` calls the `make` hook which tells the compilation to add the first module or modules to the dependency graph. These are called entry dependencies.
    ]
    ]

    ---

    ### `Compilation`

    - Represents a single build process
    - Owns the dependency and the chunk graph
    - Provides module factories that know how to build and parse modules
    - Each change creates a new compilation in `watch` mode

    ---

    .slides-content[
    <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/bf0d0d8f9196cbae65a80b8ddafcd1136b762c4f/lib/Compilation.js#L933">`lib/Compilation.js`</a>

    <img src="assets/webpack-step-6.jpg" width="700" />

    .slides-caption[
    Everytime a dependency is added to the graph, the compilation looks for a module factory for this kind of dependency. In a lot of cases, it's the [`NormalModuleFactory`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/NormalModuleFactory.js).
    ]
    ]

    ---

    ### `Module`

    - Represents a node in the dependency graph
    - Has a `parser` to parse the source code
    - Has a `generator` to generate source code
    - Holds all the relevant information for a module<br>like the source code, source map, imports and exports

    ---

    .slides-content[
    Until now, no source code has been loaded from disk.
    We just have a path to a module, which can even be relative:

    ```
    "./src/main.js"
    "../../other.js"
    "react"
    ```
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/bf0d0d8f9196cbae65a80b8ddafcd1136b762c4f/lib/NormalModuleFactory.js#L208-L220">`lib/NormalModuleFactory.js`</a>

    <img src="assets/webpack-step-7.jpg" width="700" />

    .slides-caption[
    **Step 6**: The `NormalModuleFactory` calls a `resolver` to resolve the module specifier.
    ]
    ]

    ---

    ### `Resolver`

    - Knows how to find modules
    - Resolves relative module specifiers to absolute file paths
    - Uses a bunch of lookup algorithms

    ---

    <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/T8Dhl1KPyzRqU/giphy.gif" height="300" />

    **Resolving is complicated nowadays...**

    ---

    .slides-content[
    Resolvers should at least mimic the [Node.js resolving algorithm](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html#modules_all_together):

    <img src="assets/nodejs-resolve-algo.jpg" height="400" style="margin: auto;" />
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    But for compatibility reasons, it should also look for:

    - a `browser` entry in `package.json`
    - a `module` entry in `package.json`
    - `bower_components` folders (not activated by default anymore)
    - `bower.json` (not activated by default anymore)
    - ...
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    Resolving in webpack is done by [enhanced-resolve](https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve):

    <img src="assets/webpack-enhanced-resolve.jpg" width="700" />
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/bf0d0d8f9196cbae65a80b8ddafcd1136b762c4f/lib/NormalModuleFactory.js#L270-L279">`lib/NormalModuleFactory.js`</a>

    <img src="assets/webpack-step-8.jpg" width="700" />

    .slides-caption[
    **Step 7**: Once the absolute path of the module has been resolved, webpack tries to find out which **processing rules** have been configured for this module.
    ]
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    Typical processing rules include loader configurations:

    ```
    {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        include: [resolve(projectRoot, "src")],
        use: [
            {
                loader: "babel-loader",
                options: {
                    ...babelConfig(),
                    cacheDirectory: true,
                },
            },
        ],
    },
    ```
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    .slides-label.slides-danger[Heads up]

    **All rules** will be applied, **not just the first one that matches.**
    ]

    ---

    ```
    {
      test: /app\.js$/,
      use: ["babel-loader"],
    },
    {
      test: /\.jsx?$/,
      use: ["babel-loader"],
    },
    ```

    Applies the `babel-loader` twice to `app.js`.

    ---

    .slides-content[
    <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/bf0d0d8f9196cbae65a80b8ddafcd1136b762c4f/lib/Compilation.js#L618">`lib/Compilation.js`</a>

    <img src="assets/webpack-step-9.jpg" width="700" />

    .slides-caption[
    **Step 9:** With all the processing information about the module, the `Compilation` starts the module build.
    ]
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/bf0d0d8f9196cbae65a80b8ddafcd1136b762c4f/lib/NormalModule.js#L265-L271">`lib/NormalModule.js`</a>

    <img src="assets/webpack-step-10.jpg" width="700" />

    .slides-caption[
    **Step 10:** The module calls the [`loader-runner`](https://github.com/webpack/loader-runner), which reads the file contents and processes the loader pipeline.
    ]
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### Loader

    A loader is a function that:
    
    - takes source code or binary data as input
    - and returns new source code as output.

    Loaders work on a per-file basis.
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    The simplest loader:
    
    ```
    module.exports = function (content) {
      return content;
    };
    ```
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    A simplified [`file-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader):

    ```
    module.exports = function (content) {
      const url = generateHashedUrl(content);
    
      this.emitFile(url, content);
    
      return "export default " + JSON.stringify(url) + ";";
    };
    ```

    - `this.emitFile()` tells webpack to emit a file with<br>the given contents and filename to the output folder
    - `return` the JavaScript representation of that file
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    The `loader-runner` executes the loaders from right to left:

    <div style="width: 1.5rem; height: 1.5rem; background: #46e1c8; border-radius: 100%; position: relative; left: 17.5rem; bottom: -0.5rem; visibility: hidden"></div>
    ```
    use: ["css-loader", "sass-loader"],
    // like: cssLoader(sassLoader(fileContent));
    ```
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    The `sass-loader` receives Sass source code and produces CSS source code:

    <div style="width: 1.5rem; height: 1.5rem; background: #46e1c8; border-radius: 100%; position: relative; left: 17.5rem; bottom: -0.5rem;"></div>
    ```
    use: ["css-loader", "sass-loader"],
    // like: cssLoader(sassLoader(fileContent));
    ```
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    The `css-loader` receives CSS source code and produces JavaScript code:

    <div style="width: 1.5rem; height: 1.5rem; background: #46e1c8; border-radius: 100%; position: relative; left: 8rem; bottom: -0.5rem;"></div>
    ```
    use: ["css-loader", "sass-loader"],
    // like: cssLoader(sassLoader(fileContent));
    ```
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    Before the actual execution, the `loader-runner` performs a **pitching phase** from left to right.

    This allows loaders to intercept the execution.
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    For instance, the [`thread-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/thread-loader) uses the pitching phase to push the execution to worker threads:

    ```
    use: ["thread-loader", "css-loader", "sass-loader"],
    ```
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    The result of the loader pipeline should either be:
    
    - a JavaScript module, preferably ESM
    - JSON source
    - a WebAssembly module
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/bf0d0d8f9196cbae65a80b8ddafcd1136b762c4f/lib/NormalModule.js#L445">`lib/NormalModule.js`</a>

    <img src="assets/webpack-step-11.jpg" width="700" />

    .slides-caption[
    **Step 11**: The module hands the loader result to its `parser`.
    ]
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### `Parser`

    - Parses source code to an abstract syntax tree (AST)
    - Exposes AST nodes to webpack plugins
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    Webpack uses [acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn) to parse JavaScript modules.

    During `optimizeDependencies`, the [`FlagDependencyUsagePlugin`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/df7da2cdd58e9534ae5e73a25e9c064b02c4d625/lib/FlagDependencyUsagePlugin.js#L103)
    starts to walk through the dependency graph while keeping track of exports and imports.
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    This works reliable with ESMs:

    .slides-columns[
    ```
    import {a, b} from "some-module";
    ```
    ```
    export {a, b, c, d, e, f};
    ```
    ]

    Only a and b from `"some-module"` are imported.
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    But doesn't work with CommonJS:

    .slides-columns[
    ```
    const someModule = require("some-module");
    ```
    ```
    module.exports = {a, b, c, d, e, f};
    ```
    ]

    What properties of `someModule` are used?
    ]

    ---

    Also during `optimizeDependencies`, the
    [SideEffectsFlagPlugin](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/optimize/SideEffectsFlagPlugin.js)
    looks for modules that have no side-effects.

    ---

    .slides-content[
    Consider the following situation:

    .slides-columns[
    ```
    import {a} from "some-library";
    ```
    ```
    // some-library/index.js
    import {b} from "./b.js";

    export const a = "a";
    export {b};
    ```
    ```
    // some-library/b.js
    export const b = "b";

    loginUser();
    ```
    ]

    Webpack can't remove the unused export `b` because `b.js` contains a side-effect that needs to be executed.
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    It's impossible to detect that a module contains no side-effects if there's code to be executed.

    Thus, module authors need to tell webpack explicitly in their `package.json` that their module won't execute side-effects when being imported:

    ```
    {
      "name": "some-library",
      "sideEffects": false
    }    
    ```
    ]

    ### What is the chunk graph?

    The chunk graph tells webpack which module to put in which file (chunk).

    ---

    .slides-columns[
    <img src="assets/dependency-graph.png" height="400" />
    <img src="assets/chunk-graph-simple.svg" height="400" style="visibility: hidden; margin-left: 2rem;" />
    ]

    .slides-caption[
    For example, this dependency graph would be transformed into...

    <img src="assets/dependency-graph.png" height="400" />
    <img src="assets/chunk-graph-simple.svg" height="400" style="margin-left: 2rem;" />
    ]

    .slides-caption[
    ...this chunk graph.
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    The chunk graph get's more interesting when you're using async `import()`:

    ```
    import("./a.js")
      .then(a => {
        console.log("module a has been loaded");
      });
    ```

    This tells webpack that `a.js` and all its dependencies are only necessary when the `import()` function is called.
    ]

    ---

    <div style="background-image: url(assets/chunk-tree-1.png); background-size: 900px; width: 450px; overflow: hidden; height: 300px;"></div>

    .slides-caption[
    Dashed arrows indicate async dependencies.

    <img src="assets/chunk-tree-1.png" width="900" />

    .slides-caption[
    These allow webpack to put these modules into different files.
    ]

    ---

    <img src="assets/chunk-tree-1.png" width="900" />

    .slides-caption[
    1. Notice the duplication of `b.css`
    2. Also notice the empty chunk caused<br>by `a.js` importing `b.js` asynchronously
    ]

    ---

    Calculating the optimal chunk graph is a trade-off between code duplication...

    <img src="assets/chunk-tree-2-1.png" width="600" />

    ---

    ...and big initial bundle size.

    <img src="assets/chunk-tree-2-2.png" width="600" />

    ---

    There are also other important things to consider:

    - Big chunks tend to have a **better compression rate**
    - But big chunks do also change more often which is **bad for HTTP caching**

    .slides-caption[
    **Step 16:** The `ModuleConcatenationPlugin` tries to merge as many modules as possible into one scope (function wrapper).

    ]

    ---

    This feature is also known as **scope hoisting**.
    
    It decreases the bundle size and drastically improves the app startup time.

    ---

    Old benchmark when webpack did not implement scope hoisting.<br>

    .slides-caption[
    **Step 17:** Render the chunk source code using templates (like the `MainTemplate`).

    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### Templates

    - Renders a `module`, `chunk`, ... to source code
    - May include the **module runtime**
    - Ensure that source maps are working properly
    ]

    ---

    The webpack output is an [IIFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression) that can be divided into two parts:

    ```
    (function (modules) {
      // module runtime
    })([
      // module function wrappers
      function () {
        // source code of module 1
      },
      function () {
        // source code of module 2, 3, 4
      }
    ])
    ```

    ### The remaining boring steps

    - **Step 18:** Minimize JavaScript using [UglifyJS](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin)
    - **Step 19:** Write assets into output directory (emit)

    ## How do you get the most out of it?

    ---
    layout: true
    class: slides-centered
    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### 1.

    Write ECMAScript modules.

    Write idiomatic JavaScript code (listen to Benedikt &amp; Sigurd).
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### 2.

    Make sure that your babel- or typescript-loader generate ESMs:

    .slides-columns[
    ```
    // .babelrc.js
    {
      presets: [
        // babel 7 does that by default
        // babel 6
        ["env", {
          // don't transpile modules
          modules: false
        }],
      ],
    }
    ```
    ```
    // tsconfig.json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
          "module": "esnext",
      },
    }
    ```
    ]
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### 3.

    Don't do side-effects in the top-level module scope...

    ```
    import {loginUser} from "./loginUser.js";

    loginUser() // please don't do that
      .then(() => {
        console.log("User logged in");
      })
    ```

    ...unless it's the entry module.
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### 4.

    Tell webpack about your good intentions by setting [`sideEffects: false`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/#mark-the-file-as-side-effect-free) in your `package.json`

    ```
    {
      "sideEffects": false
    }
    ```
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### 5.

    Use the [`module` field](https://github.com/dherman/defense-of-dot-js/blob/master/proposal.md) in your `package.json` to point webpack to ESM code instead of an unoptimizable `dist.js`.

    ```
    {
      "main": "./dist.js"
      "module" "./esm.js"
    }
    ```

    `esm.js` should still be transpiled down to ES5, except imports and exports.
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### 6.

    Use `import()` where possible to defer less important code.

    ```
    async function openModal() {
      const modal = await import("./modal.js");

      modal.open();
    }
    ```
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### 7.

    Use the magic webpack comment [`webpackPrefetch: true`](https://medium.com/webpack/link-rel-prefetch-preload-in-webpack-51a52358f84c).

    ```
    import(/* webpackPrefetch: true */"./modal.js");
    ```

    Webpack will use `&lt;link rel="prefetch">` to prefetch chunks in browser idle times.
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### 8.

    Enable persistent loader caches if supported to reduce the build time.

    ```
    {
      loader: "babel-loader",
      options: {
        cacheDirectory: true
      }
    }
    ```

    (or use the [cache-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/cache-loader))
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### 9.

    Restrict the scope of your loader pipelines to your `src` folder.

    ```
    {
      test: /\.jsx?$/,
      include: [resolve(projectRoot, "src")],
      use: [
        "babel-loader"
      ]
    },
    ```
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### 10.

    Remember that each `import` of a `.scss` or `.less` file is a separate Sass or Less compilation.

    ```
    import "./modal.less";  // <---- may contain duplicate css
    import "./map.less";    // <---- may contain duplicate css
    ```
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### 11.

    Check the [`webpack-bundle-analyzer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer) from time to time.

    <img src="./assets/webpack-bundle-analyzer.gif" height="300" />
    ]

    ---

    .slides-content[
    ### 12.

    Listen to webpack's performance hints:
