## HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

Since Let's Encrypt launched in 2016, the project has gone through the roof: 20 million issued certificates, almost 25 million fully qualified domains active. Many webhosters are supporting the deployment of Let's Encrypt certificates automatically via their webinterfaces. However, deploying HTTPS professionally brings along higher requirements like [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) in combination with [HPKP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Public_Key_Pinning), which needs more background knowledge and configuration. I will give you a short insight into how Let's Encrypt works and other TLS/HTTPS security best practices.

## The future of frontend tooling

Our frontend toolstack has become quite complex over the past few years. In order to overcome typical problems when building large websites, we've built a variety of tools with shiny names like Grunt, Gulp or Webpack. However, things are about to change. With new technologies like HTTP2, ES2015 and Web Components around the corner, we need to ask ourselves: are the best practices from today still valid in the future? What kind of tools will we be using in the next few years? Will we need them at all? In my talk, I am going to show you how these new technologies will change the way we work.
