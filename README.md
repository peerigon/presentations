## The bumpy road to Universal JavaScript

Since the mid 90s, developers have struggled to build web applications that can be executed both on the client and the server. And still today, even with Node.js and virtual DOM libraries like React, this can be quite challenging.

In this talk, we'll look at common obstacles and problems that developers face when building this type of web application, including typical performance and security issues. You'll leave the presentation knowing how to build a fast and secure web application that can be rendered on the client and the server.

## HTTP/2

HTTP/2 is not the new kid on the block anymore, but it's still not as widely adopted as one might think. This talk is about the history of HTTP, reasons why HTTP 1.x does not work as well anymore and of course about the architecture and features of HTTP/2.

## JavaScript RoadTrip

Smartphone, Tablet, Desktop: Everybody uses Web applications like Spotify, Slack or Facebook every day. So why not develop an infotainment system based on open web technology? We want to share our experience gained in the developing of the Sono Motors infotainment system: What do you have to keep in mind for using it in a car? How can you implement an interface on Smartphone and Dashboard? How is it even possible to control and pilot a car with JavaScript? After this talk your dream of your own infotainment system is closer then ever!

## HTTP/2 for data networking

Everyone is talking about the impact of HTTP/2 (H2) on static assets like HTML, CSS or images. But what does it mean for data? How does it change REST and do we still need WebSockets? This talk highlights some basics of H2 and aims to answer common questions by API developers with benchmarks performed using H1 and H2 repectively.

## HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

Since Let's Encrypt launched in 2016, the project has gone through the roof: 20 million issued certificates, almost 25 million fully qualified domains active. Many webhosters are supporting the deployment of Let's Encrypt certificates automatically via their webinterfaces. However, deploying HTTPS professionally brings along higher requirements like [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) in combination with [HPKP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Public_Key_Pinning), which needs more background knowledge and configuration. I will give you a short insight into how Let's Encrypt works and other TLS/HTTPS security best practices.

## The future of frontend tooling

Our frontend toolstack has become quite complex over the past few years. In order to overcome typical problems when building large websites, we've built a variety of tools with shiny names like Grunt, Gulp or Webpack. However, things are about to change. With new technologies like HTTP2, ES2015 and Web Components around the corner, we need to ask ourselves: are the best practices from today still valid in the future? What kind of tools will we be using in the next few years? Will we need them at all? In my talk, I am going to show you how these new technologies will change the way we work.
